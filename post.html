                    <p class="post-excerpt">After several months of learning in the 
                    Frontend Developer Career Path, I've made the big jump over to the 
                    Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects
                    and meet like-minded peers.</p>

                <div class="post-main-content post-width">
                    <h4>How I stay committed to learning</h4> 

                    <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. 
                        I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using 
                        what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.</p>
                        
                    <p>While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and 
                        most things about my journey with the world.</p>
                                                
                    <h4>How I got started</h4>                        
                    
                    <p>I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about 
                        what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect 
                        on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.</p>
                        
                    <p>That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries 
                        was also helping others learn and stay motivated.</p>
